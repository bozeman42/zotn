## Usage concept
This game is intended to be played at game conventions, specifically [Con of the North](http://www.conofthenorth.org/). Players check in to the system using their convention badge, which has a QR code on the front. In conventions without such a badge, player badges can be produced.

Players are assigned a faction and are issued a faction lanyard.

Players interact as they move about the convention and interact through exchanges of QR coded assets and check in at game kiosks periodically to turn in zombie/hunter kills and purchase new supplies with in game credits.
